A lightweight (uses a few MB of RAM and almost no CPU) utility that makes the Windows taskbar translucent/transparent on Windows 10.

You can see examples of the customizations you can make in the images below:

## Features

- Advanced **color picker** supporting alpha and live preview to change the taskbar's color.
- **Taskbar states** (choose one - color can be customized on every state except Normal):
  - **Normal**: Regular Windows style. (as if TranslucentTB was not running)
  - **Opaque**: Tinted taskbar, without transparency.
  - **Clear**: Tinted taskbar.
  - **Blur**: Will make the taskbar slightly blurred.
  - **Acrylic**: Will give the taskbar an appearance similar to Microsoft's Fluent Design guidelines.
- **Dynamic** modes (these can be used together and each of them provides a taskbar state and color you can customize):
  - **Dynamic Windows**: Will change the taskbar to a different appearance if a window is currently maximised or visible.
  - **Dynamic Start Menu**: Will change the taskbar appearance when the start menu is opened.
  - **Dynamic Cortana**: Will change the taskbar appearance when Cortana (or the search menu if Cortana is disabled) is open.
  - **Dynamic Timeline**: Will change the taskbar apperance when the Timeline is open.
- Ability to **show or hide the Aero Peek button** depending on the currently active dynamic mode.
- Compatible with [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)!

## Download

You can download the program for free from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PF4KZ2VN4W9) and take advantage of its features like background auto-updates and settings sync.

If you prefer a classical download, you can do so [via the releases tab](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB/releases).

If you want to get the latest bleeding edge build, you can grab it over at the [Azure Pipelines page](https://dev.azure.com/sylve0n/TranslucentTB/_build?definitionId=4). Note that these build may not work, or include features that are partially complete. Use at your own risk.

## Add to Startup

To add TranslucentTB to startup, check the "Open at boot" entry in the TranslucentTB tray icon's context menu. If it is grayed out, TranslucentTB startup has been disabled by your organization.

### Similar programs

If you are looking for something that modifies more than just the taskbar, there are several programs out there.

- [Taskbar Tools](https://github.com/Elestriel/TaskbarTools) is a similar program written in C#. However, it seems to be unmaintaned.
- [TaskbarX](https://github.com/ChrisAnd1998/TaskbarX) can also change the taskbar appearance, but it lacks TranslucentTB's dynamic modes.

You may have seen similar translucency abilities from programs such as StartIsBack, Start10 and the now defunct Classic Shell. All of these are great programs, but I don't need the start-replacement features, so I wrote this.
TranslucentTB also allows for more customizability over the taskbar with features such as Dynamic Windows, Dynamic Peek and Dynamic Start that these programs don't have. The storage and memory impact is also lesser.
